Documentation of Wool
=====================
This is the documentation of Wool, the woolly mammoth of deployment utilities.

Wool is an opinionated deployment utility.
This means wool mostly knows how it will be deploying each web app.

We've taken the fabfile.py from the default Mezzanine project template and will be attempting to take it to the next level.

We're currently working towards version 0.1.0.
As development pursues, wool shouldn't be used in your system.
There isn't even testing!
